## Financial 2 ##

A simple set of functions for determining the time value of money:

### Future Value ###

A coefficient for calculating the future value of an investment. To get the future value, you multiply this number by the present value.

* Inputs
    + Y register: interest rate per compounding period
    + X register: number of compounding periods
* Output
    + X register: the future value coefficient


### Present Value ###

A coefficient for calculating the present value of an investment. To get the future value, you multiply this number by the future value.

* Inputs
    + Y register: interest rate per compounding period
    + X register: number of compounding periods
* Output
    + X register: the present value coefficient

### Loan Payment ###

A coefficient for calculating the periodic payment of a loan. To get the payment amount, you multiply the initial principal by this coefficient.

* Inputs
    + Y register: interest rate per period
    + X register: number of periods in the loan
* Output
    + X register: the payment coefficient

### Loan Interest ###

A coefficient for calculating the total interest of a loan. To get the interest amount, you multiply the initial principal by this coefficient.

* Inputs
    + Y register: interest rate per period
    + X register: number of periods in the loan
* Output
    + X register: the total interest coefficient


## Probability ##

A set of functions for probability distributions.

### Std Normal PDF ###

The probability density function of a standard normal variable.

* Input
    + X register: the value of the variable, x
* Output
    + X register: the value of the standard normal PDF at x

### Std Normal CDF ###

The cumulative density function of a standard normal variable.

* Input
    + X register: the value of the variable, x
* Output
    + X register: the value of the standard normal CDF at x


### Inverse Std Normal CDF ###

The inverse cumulative density function of a standard normal variable.

* Input
    + X register: the probability, p
* Output
    + X register: the value of the variable, x, associated with p


## Weather ##

Functions for determining the "feels like" temperature.

### Wind Chill ###

The wind chill index for cold and windy days.

* Inputs
    + Y register: the wind speed in mph
    + X register: the temperature in 째F
* Output
    + X register: the wind chill index, a "feels like" temperature in 째F

### Heat Index ###

The heat index for hot and humid days.

* Inputs
    + Y register: the relative humidity in %
    + X register: the temperature in 째F
* Output
    + X register: the heat index, a "feels like" temperature in 째F
